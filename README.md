## Introduction

For this personal project, I wanted to build a dashboard that would be useful for all the students in my cohort. It lists the websites we use on a daily basis to attend our classes, as well as a list of all the students in the class, our logo, our group charter, and finally, a list of all the useful resources shared by the students.

## How to use

To use this project, clone this repository, navigate to it using "cd," run "npm install," and then "npm run dev" if you want to run a local server.
Alternatively, you can visit the deployed URL: https://wildboard.onrender.com/

## Workflow

For this project, I wanted to use Docker for deployment, so I deployed an image on DockerHub.

I used the npm package "aos" for animations and styled components to practice on the subject.
